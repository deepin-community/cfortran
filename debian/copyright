 Kevin,
 .
 [Just noticed that I didn't send this yesterady.]
 .
 I have no time right now to read through licenses.
 IIRC, library GPL is fairly unrestrictive, so I'll choose that. So.....
 .
 You may consider this e-mail as a notice that as an alternative to any
 other cfortran licenses,
 I hereby release all versions and all parts of cfortran under the
 the Library GPL license.
 From among these licenses, the user is free to choose
 the license or licenses under which cfortran is used.
 .
 Contact me if you'd like to be able to choose another license.
 .
