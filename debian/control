Description: Header file permitting Fortran routines to be called in C/C++
 cfortran.h is an easy-to-use powerful bridge between C and FORTRAN.
 It provides a completely transparent, machine independent interface between
 C and FORTRAN routines (= subroutines and/or functions) and global data,
 i.e. structures and COMMON blocks.
